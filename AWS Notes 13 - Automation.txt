CloudFormation:
- A provisioning automation service for setting up AWS services. 
- Stacks: 
	- you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack. 
	- You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks. 
	- Stacks can be nested. E.g. An application stack referencing a network stack.
	- Stacks are created using CloudFromation templates.
	- Stack creation errors: by default the whole stack is rolled back.
- Templates:
	- You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. 
	- A template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file used as a blueprint for building your AWS resources.
	- Templates include several major sections. The Resources section is the only required section.
	- Templates can be imported from S3 or uploaded from your computer.
- Parameters Section:
	- Values to pass to your template at runtime (when you create or update a stack). 
	- You can refer to parameters from the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.
	- You can have a maximum of 200 parameters in a template.
	- Parameters can be marked as mandatory or optional. In the latter case, you provide a default value.
- Rules section:
	- Validates a parameter or a combination of parameters passed to a template during a stack creation or stack update.
- Mappings section:
	- a mappings section can include multiple maps.
	- Each map is a list of map keys.
	- Each map key points to a dictionary of key-value pairs.
	- Eg: map of Regions: map key = region name. Key-value pairs: AMI IDs in that region.
	- You can match a key to a corresponding value by using the Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function in the Resources and Outputs sections. 
- Resources section:
	- Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket. 
	- You can refer to resources in the Resources and Outputs sections of the template.
	- With the DependsOn attribute you can specify that the creation of a specific resource follows another. 
- Outputs section:
	- A list of dictionaries with the following keys: OutputKey, OutputValue, Description.
	- You can declare a maximum of 200 outputs in a template. 
- Stack modification:
	- you can make changes to a stack without having to tear it down and recreate it.
	- Direct Changes: used for quick changes.
	- Change Set: used for more complex changes and when you want to review the changes before applying them. A change set is saved.
- Stack drifting:
	- CloudFromation can detect drifted configurations: resources that have been changed from outside CloudFormation and do not match therefore the template.
	- Not supported on all resources.
	- The execution of a stack drifting search is launched manually.
- StackSets:
	- StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation. 
	- A stack instance is a reference to a stack in a target account within a Region. 
	- Using an administrator account, you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts across specified regions. 
	- An administrator account is the AWS account in which you create stack sets. 
	- A target account is the account into which you create, update, or delete one or more stacks in your stack set. 
	- Stack sets can be created using either self-managed permissions or service-managed permissions.
	- With self-managed permissions, you create the IAM roles in each target account to enable the deployment of the stack instances.
	- With service-managed permissions, you can deploy stack instances to accounts managed by AWS Organizations. StackSets creates the necessary IAM roles on your behalf in current and future accounts of the Organization.
- Deletion Policy:
	- With the DeletionPolicy attribute you can preserve, and in some cases, backup a resource when its stack is deleted.
	- You specify a DeletionPolicy attribute for each resource that you want to control. 
	- If a resource has no DeletionPolicy attribute, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource by default. Exception: The default policy is Snapshot for RDS.
	- To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify "DeletionPolicy: Retain" for that resource. 
	- You can choose also "DeletionPolicy: Snapshot" for the following resources: EC2 Volume, RDS, Redshift, ElastiCache, Neptune.
- Puppet and Chef Integration.
- You can define Bootstrap scripts.
- Supports WaitCondition


==============================================

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM):
- An open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS.
- A serverless application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks.
- A serverless application is more than just a Lambda function—it can include additional resources such as APIs, databases, and event source mappings. 
- SAM template specification: 
	- You define your serverless application with a simple and clean syntax to describe the functions, APIs, permissions, configurations, and events that make up a serverless application. 
	- SAM is an extension of CloudFormation: you can define resources by using CloudFormation in your SAM template.
- SAM CLI: 
	- You build serverless applications that are defined by SAM templates.
	- The CLI provides a Lambda-like execution environment locally for testing and debugging.
- You can publish or use server less applications in the AWS Serverless Application Repository. 


==============================================

OpsWorks:
- a configuration management service that helps you configure and operate applications in a cloud enterprise by using Puppet or Chef. 


==============================================


AWS Step Functions:
- A serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications.
- Through Step Functions' graphical console, you see your application’s workflow as a series of event-driven steps. 
- Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks.
- A state machine is a workflow.
- Each step in a workflow is a state. 
- The workflow is written using the Amazon States Language (JSON formatted).
- Two types of state machines/workflows: 
	- Standard workflow: can run for up to 1 year, up to 2,000 executions per second, employs an at-most-once model.
	- Express workflow: can run for up to 5 minutes, up to 100,000 executions per second, employs an at-least-once model (can have duplicate executions). A popular use case is ingesting high throughput IoT messages.
- A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs.
- Callback tasks:
	- Callback tasks provide a way to pause a workflow until a task token is returned. 
	- A task might need to wait for a human approval, integrate with a third party, or call legacy systems. 


Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF):
- Makes it easy to build applications that coordinate work across distributed components.
- A task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your application.
- Coordinating tasks across the application involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. 
- You implement workers to perform tasks. 
- Workers can run either on cloud or on-prem.
- You can create tasks that are long-running, or that may fail, time out, or require restarts—or that may complete with varying throughput and latency. 
- Amazon SWF stores tasks and assigns them to workers when they are ready, tracks their progress, and maintains their state, including details on their completion.
- To coordinate tasks, you write a program that gets the latest state of each task from Amazon SWF and uses it to initiate subsequent tasks. 
- Amazon SWF maintains an application's execution state durably so that the application is resilient to failures in individual components.
- Unlike Step Functions, a user has to manage the infrastructure that runs the workflow logic and tasks. 


Q: When should I use AWS Step Functions vs. Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF)?
- You should consider using AWS Step Functions for all your new applications, since it provides a more productive and agile approach to coordinating application components using visual workflows.
- If you require external signals to intervene in your processes, or you would like to launch child processes that return a result to a parent, then you should consider Amazon SWF.
- With Amazon SWF, instead of writing state machines in declarative JSON, you write a decider program to separate activity steps from decision steps. This provides you complete control over your orchestration logic, but increases the complexity of developing applications.

AWS Systems Manager (formerly known as SSM):
- An AWS service that you can use to view and manage your instances’ OS on AWS. 
- Capabilities:
	- Operations Management.
	- Application Management: create, manage, and deploy application configurations. Includes the « Parameter Store ».
	- Change Management: enterprise change management framework for requesting, approving, implementing, and reporting on operational changes to your application configuration and infrastructure. 
	- Node Management: OS/software inventory, patch management, troubleshooting, ..
	- Shared Resources (SSM Documents).
- SSM agent:
	- On EC2: installed by default in Amazon AMIs. Needs to be enabled and started.
	- Can also be installed on on-prem servers. This is called a Hybrid environment. Needs an Amazon provided certificate and activate code.
	- The EC2 instance needs to have an instance profile (IAM role) so that the agent can push data to SSM.
	- A managed instance is any EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. 
- SSM Parameter Store:
	- Provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data and secrets management. 
	- You can store data such as passwords, database strings, EC2 instance IDs and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values.
	- You can store values as plain text or encrypted data using a KMS CMK (SecureString parameter type).
	- Parameters are retrieved using the GetParameter API call to ssm.{region}.amazonaws.com.
	- The parameters hierarchy is similar to a file path.
	- You can choose to encrypt your SecureString parameters using either:
		- a customer-managed KMS key: all users within the customer account have access to the default AWS managed key. 
		- or the default AWS-managed KMS key: you need to add an IAM permission to the user to use KMS operations on this KMS key.
	- You can use AWS CloudTrail to monitor SecureString parameter activities. 
- SSM Inventory:
	- Collects metadata from your instances: OS, applications, files, network, …etc.
	- You can also collect custom inventory metadata.
	- To assign custom inventory to an instance, you can either store this metadata in a JSON file on your instance or use the Systems Manager PutInventory API action.
	- The shortest period for inventory is 30mn.
	- The inventory configuration is called an SSM association. Creating and association gives you an association ID and code.
	- The collected data can be stored in S3.
- SSM Run Command 
	- Enables you to automate common administrative tasks and perform ad hoc configuration changes at scale. 
	- Examples: install or bootstrap applications, build a deployment pipeline, capture log files when an instance is terminated from an Auto Scaling group, and join instances to a Windows domain.
- SSM document:
	- Defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances. 
	- Systems Manager includes more than 100 pre-configured documents that you can use by specifying parameters at runtime.
	- Documents use JSON or YAML formats, and they include steps and parameters that you specify. 
	- Command/Automation documents: Used by "Run Command" to run commands. Used by "State Manager" to apply a configuration. Used by "Maintenance Windows" to apply a configuration based on the specified schedule. 
	- Package documents: Used by "Distributor" to install software on managed instances.
	- Session document: Session Manager uses session documents to determine which type of session to start.
	- CloudFormation document: you can choose to store your AWS CloudFormation templates in SSM.
- SSM Patch Manager:
	- You can use Patch Manager to apply patches for both operating systems and applications.
	- Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches.
	- Can target individual instances or a group of instances. Can target instances having specific tags.
	- Can scan your instances and report compliance on a schedule, install available patches on a schedule, and patch or scan instances on demand whenever you need to. 
	- You create Maintenance Windows to run patching.
	- Uses "Run Command" in the background.
- SSM Change Calendar: lets you set up date and time ranges when actions you specify (for example, in Systems Manager Automation documents) may or may not be performed in your AWS account. 
- SSM Session Manager: lets you connect to your instances without using a bastion host.
