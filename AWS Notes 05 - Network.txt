===============================================

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
- A virtual network for your account inside the AWS Cloud.
- You have a default VPC in your AWS account but you can add more VPCs.
- Resides in only one region.
- Has CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) blocks of IP addresses.
- Can have multiple subnets.

CIDR block:
- Can have a mask from /16 to /28.
- A VPC has one primary IPv4 CIDR block.
- You can associate secondary IPv4 CIDR blocks with your VPC.
- You cannot increase or decrease the size of an existing CIDR block.
- In the same VPC, you cannot mix CIDR blocks between RFC 1918 ranges: 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16.

Subnets:
- A subnet resides in only one Availability Zone.
- AWS reserves 5 IP addresses per Subnet (first 4 and last 1).
- Automatic routing between subnets inside a VPC.

Subnet type:
- Public subnet. 
- Private subnet.
- VPN-only subnet.

Public Subnet:
- Any subnet with a (default) route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
- If you want your instance in a public subnet to communicate with the internet, it must have a public IP address (dynamic) or an Elastic IP address (static). 

Private Subnet:
- Does not have a route to an Internet Gateway.
- Instances in a private subnet can still reach internet through a NAT gateway or NAT instance. In this case the default route of the subnet is the NAT Gateway/Instance.
- The NAT Gateway/Instance sends traffic to the Internet Gateway.
- The NAT Gateway/Instance is created in the public subnet and has another interface in the private subnet.

VPN-only subnet:
- If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the subnet is known as a VPN-only subnet.

Sharing VPC/Subnets:
- VPC sharing allows multiple AWS accounts to create their resources into shared, centrally-managed VPCs. 
- In this model, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations.
- After a subnet is shared:
	- Participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them.
	- Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner. 
- You must enable resource sharing from the management account for your organization. 
- You cannot share:
	- default subnets,
	- any subnets in the default VPC.

=====================================

IP Addressing:
- An instance’s primary interface gets (manually or automatically) a MANDATORY private IPv4 address from the subnet range.
- In ADDITION to the private IP address, you can associate the following IP addresses to your interface:
	- Public IP address: Dynamic IPv4 public address.
	- Elastic IP address: Static IPv4 public address.
	- IPv6 address.

Public IP Addresses:
- Allocated dynamically from the AWS public addresses pool.
- The subnet has a modifiable attribute that determines whether instances launched into that subnet receive a public IP address. This attribute is:
	- Enabled by default in a default subnet. 
	- Disabled by default in a non-default subnet. 

Elastic IP addresses:
- Static IPv4 public address.
- Can be provided by AWS or you can bring your own public IP addresses (BYOIP).
- An Elastic IP address is a property of a network interface.
- It can be associated with a single instance or network interface at a time. 
- You're limited to five Elastic IP addresses per account. 
- A public IP address is mapped to the primary private IP address through network address translation (NAT) by the Internet Gateway. 

An Elastic IP address doesn’t incur charges as long as all the following conditions are true:
	- The Elastic IP address is associated with an EC2 instance.
	- The instance associated with the Elastic IP address is running.
	- The instance has only one Elastic IP address attached to it.
	- The Elastic IP address is associated with an attached network interface, such as a Network Load Balancer or NAT gateway.

IPv6 Addressing:
- You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, and associate IPv6 CIDR blocks with your subnets.
- The IPv6 CIDR block for your VPC is automatically assigned from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses; you cannot choose the range yourself. 
- Each instance will have BOTH an IPv4 and an IPv6 address. You are therefore bound to the number of available IPv4 addresses in your subnet.

=====================================

DHCP:
- When you create a VPC, AWS creates a set of DHCP options and associates them with the VPC.
- You can configure your own DHCP options set for your VPC. 
- By default, all instances in a non-default VPC receive an unresolvable host name that AWS assigns (for example, ip-10-0-0-202). 
- In the DHCP options sets you can define:
	- domain-name-servers: up to 4. Default=AmazonProvidedDNS (AWS Route 53 Resolver).
	- domain-name. Default={region}.compute.internal.
	- ntp-servers. Default=None.
	- netbios-name-servers. Up to 4. Default=None.
	- netbios-node-type. Default=None.
- After you create a set of DHCP options, you can't modify them. You need to create another set.
- You can also set up your VPC to use no DHCP options at all. 

=====================================

VPC DNS Services:
- DNS services are provided by the "Amazon Route 53 Resolver" on the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus 2 (e.g. 10.0.0.2).
- Do not confuse this with the Route 53 private/public hosted zones.
- We provide your instance in a VPC with public and private DNS hostnames that correspond to the public IPv4 and private IPv4 addresses for the instance.
- We do not provide DNS hostnames for IPv6 addresses. 
- Private (internal) DNS Hostname:
	- Format:  ip-{private-ipv4-address}.{region}.compute.internal except for the us-east-1 Region.
	- Resolves to the private IPv4 address of the instance. 
	- When you launch an instance into a VPC, it always receives a private DNS hostname. 
- Public (external) DNS Hostname:
	- Format: ec2-{public-ipv4-address}.{region}.compute.amazonaws.com except for the us-east-1 Region.
	- Resolves to the public IPv4 address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance. 
	- When you launch an instance into a VPC, it receives a public DNS hostname if it has a public IPv4 address, and if both the DNS hostnames and DNS support attributes for your VPC are set to true. 

DNS Support Attributes in the VPC:
- enableDnsSupport: Indicates whether the DNS resolution is supported.
- enableDnsHostnames: Indicates whether instances with public IP addresses get corresponding public DNS hostnames. 
- By default, both attributes are set to true in a default VPC or a VPC created by the VPC wizard. 
- By default, only the enableDnsSupport attribute is set to true in a VPC created any other way. 

DNS Private Hosted Zones:
- A service provided by AWS Route 53.
- If you want to access the resources in your VPC using custom DNS domain names, such as "example.com", instead of using private IPv4 addresses or AWS-provided private DNS hostnames, you can create a private hosted zone in Route 53. 
- A private hosted zone does not expose your resources to the Internet. Private hosted zones accept DNS queries only from a VPC DNS server.
- VPC Association:
	- When you create a private hosted zone, you must associate a VPC (from the same account) with the hosted zone.
	- After you create the hosted zone, you can associate additional VPCs with it, including VPCs in different AWS accounts. 
	- If you want to associate a VPC in Account A with a private hosted zone in Account B, you need first to create an "Association Authorization" in Account B.
	- A single VPC can be associated to multiple Hosted Zones. You can therefore associate your VPC with your hosted zone in your account and with hosted zones in other accounts.
- If you use custom DNS domain names defined in a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53, the enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport attributes must be set to True.
- Supported routing policies: simple, failover, multivalue answer, and weighted records. Refer to the "Route 53" notes for more details on these policies.
- You can associate Route 53 health checks only with failover, multivalue answer, and weighted records. 
- You cannot create NS records in a private hosted zone to delegate responsibility for a subdomain.


=====================================

Elastic Network Interface (ENI):
- A logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network port.
- Can include the following attributes:
	- A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
	- One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
	- One Elastic IP address (IPv4) per private IPv4 address
	- One public IPv4 address per private IPv4 address
	- One IPv6 address per private IPv4 address
	- One or more security groups
	- A MAC address
	- A source/destination check flag
	- A description
- You can create and configure network interfaces in your account and attach them to instances in your VPC.
- The attributes of a network interface follow it as it's attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. 
- Primary ENI:
	- Each instance has a default ENI, called the primary network interface (eth0). 
	- Cannot be detached.
- Secondary ENIs:
	- An instance can have secondary ENIs,
	- Can be in the same or different subnet.
	- Must be in the same AZ.
- Max number of network interfaces determined by the instance type.
- Performance is also determined by the instance type.


Network cards:
- Instances with multiple network cards provide higher network performance, including bandwidth capabilities above 100 Gbps and improved packet rate performance. 
- The P4d instance type can have 4 network cards. All other types can have only one network card.
- A Network Card can have multiple network interfaces (max defined by instance type).
- Each network interface is attached to one network card. 
- The primary network interface must be assigned to network card index 0. 
- Elastic Network Adapter (ENA): supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps for supported instance types. 
- Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) .


Enhanced Networking:
- Available on two card types: Amazon ENA (up to 100G) and Intel 82599 (Up to 10G).
- Uses SR-IOV (device pass-through) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. 
- Supports Jumbo Frames (useful for iSCSI performance).
- Only supported on Hardware Virtualization (HVM) and not on Paravirtualized (PV) instances.


Global Accelerator: 
- Provides two anycast Public IP addresses that will forward your traffic to the nearest AWS POP.
- From the POP, your traffic to the resource behind these IP addresses will therefore go through the AWS backbone instead of crossing the Internet. Provides high and consistent bandwidth.
- You can enable AWS Shield (Standard or Advanced) protection on your Accelerator.
- AWS Shield Advanced will automatically detect the type of AWS resource behind the Accelerator and apply the relevant advanced DDoS protections. 


============================

VPC Security Groups: 
- Ingress & egress, stateful firewall.
- Applied at the resource level (Instance, ELB, ...),
- Unnumbered rules (no order).
- Allow-list model: All rules are Allow rules. Anything that is not explicitly allowed is denied (micro-segmentation).
- If the source/destination is another security group, all network interfaces assigned to that referenced security group are included in the rule.
- No implicit allow between group members.
- A single interface can be member of multiple security groups.
- By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic.
- The default security group for your VPC:
	- Your VPC automatically comes with a default security group.
	- If you don't specify a different security group when you launch the instance, we associate the default security group with your instance. 
	- Name starts with sg-….
	- Allows inbound traffic from network interfaces that are assigned to the same security group. 
	- Allows all outbound traffic.


Network Access Control List (NACL): 
- Source/dest and protocol filtering, Stateless.
- Applied at the subnet level,
- Rules can be allow or deny.
- Rules are numbered (have an order).
- Asterisk rule:
	- Each network ACL includes a deny-all rule whose rule number is an asterisk (*).
	- The rule is the last in order.
	- Cannot be modified/removed. 
- Default Network ACL:
	- Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL.
	- By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
- Custom Network ACL:
	- You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. 
	- By default, (because of the unremovable asterisk rule) each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. 

============================

Route table:
- Lives inside a VPC. 
- A VPC has a default route table (Main route table) but you can add other route tables (Custom tables).
- Three types of Route Tables:
	- Subnet route table: associated to one or more subnets.
	- Gateway route table: associated with an internet gateway or virtual private gateway. 
	- Local Gateway route table: a route table that's associated with an Outposts local gateway.
- Subnet route table:
	- A Subnet has only one route table attached.
	- Any subnet that is not explicitly associated to a route table is implicitly associated to the Main route table.
	- The "Main Route Table" designation can be changed to another table. In that case, the implicit associations follow the change.
- Gateway route table: 
	- Used to send ingress traffic to an appliance for inspection.
	- You can only specify "local", a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, or a network interface as a target. 
- The most specific route wins.
- Destinations:
	- Default route: Destination="0.0.0.0/0" or "::/0".
	- Destination can be a prefix list (pl-…….). See below.
- Targets:
	- Local (local).
	- NAT/Instance Gateway (nat-gateway-…).
	- Internet Gateway (igw-….).
	- Egress-only Internet Gateway (eigw-….).
	- Local Gateway for Outposts (lgw-….).
	- Transit Gateway (tgw-….).
	- Virtual Private Gateway (vgw-….).
	- Peering Connextion (pcx-…..).
	- VPC Endpoint (vpce-…..).
	- Network Interface (eni-….)
- Local route:
	- Target="Local".
	- Added by default for the VPC CIDR range.
	- Cannot be changed/removed.
	- You cannot add more specific routes than the local route.

============================

Prefix lists:
- A prefix list is a set of one or more CIDR blocks. 
- There are two types of prefix lists: AWS-managed and Customer-managed.
- AWS-managed prefix list:
	- Represents the IP address ranges for an AWS service like S3 for example.
	- The address ranges are maintained by AWS.
	- You can reference an AWS-managed prefix list in your VPC security group rules and in subnet route table entries.
	- You cannot create, modify, share, or delete an AWS-managed prefix list.
- Customer-managed prefix list:
	- A set of IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR blocks. You define and manage this list.
	- You can reference the prefix list in your VPC security group rules, subnet route table entries, and transit gateway route table entries. 
	- You can share your prefix list with other AWS accounts, enabling those accounts to reference the prefix list in their own resources.
	- Can be used only in the same region.
- When you create a prefix list, you must specify the maximum number of entries that the prefix list can support. Cannot be modified.
- When you reference a prefix list in a resource, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists counts as the consumed number of rules or entries for the resource. 

============================

Internet Gateway (IGW):
- A resource to enable a VPC to connect to internet.
- Attached to a VPC. You can only have one IGW per VPC.
- Performs NAT for public IP addresses that are associated to EC2 instances.
- Works for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Egress-only Internet Gateway (EIGW):
- Stateful egress-only IPv6-only gateway.
- Allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances. 
- To enable outbound-only internet communication over IPv4, use a NAT gateway instead. 

============================

NAT:
- For IPv4: You can use either a NAT instance or NAT Gateway.
- For IPv6: You need to use an Egress-only Internet Gateway because IPv6 addresses are public by default.

NAT Gateway: 
- A service managed by Amazon, 
- Each NAT gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone. 
- Automatic failover, 
- A NAT gateway supports 5 Gbps of bandwidth and automatically scales up to 45 Gbps.  
- Features NOT supported on NAT Gateway: Port Forwarding, Bastion Host, Traffic Metrics, Security Groups.
- You create a NAT gateway in a public subnet and it automatically gets a private IP address from your subnet range.
- You can associate exactly one Elastic IP address with a NAT gateway. Cannot be disassociated after it's created. 
- A NAT gateway supports the following protocols: TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- You cannot associate a security group with a NAT gateway. 
- Cannot be used by resources through a VPC peering or a S2S VPN connection.
- You can have multiple NAT Gateways per VPC. Separate per Subnet.


NAT Instance: 
- An EC2 instance with a NAT software. 
- You create and manage the instance and NAT software.
- You need to disable Source/Destination check on the network interface.
- Subnet failover to another NAT instance is supported. you need to use scripts to manage failover, 
- throughput depends on size of instance. 
- Can become a bottleneck.
- Scale Up: increase size or boost throughput using enhanced networking (SRIOV, …).
- Scale Out: split the workloads on different subnets with a NAT instance for each of these subnets.
- Supports manual port forwarding, bastion server, CloudWatch alarms.
- Supports Public IP addresses and Elastic IP Addresses. Can be changed.
- Private IP manually assigned.

============================

VPC Endpoint (VPCE): 
- Enables you to access an AWS service (like S3) or a VPC Endpoint Service directly from your VPC without going out through internet.
- Lives inside a VPC,
- VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components.
- Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. 
- Supported within the same Region only.
- A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint.

AWS PrivateLink:
- A technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses. 
- A "VPC Endpoint Service" is a service hosted by another AWS customer or Partner in their own VPC.
- You can create your "VPC Endpoint Service" for your own application in your VPC:
	- You configure it as an AWS PrivateLink-powered service (referred to as an endpoint service).
	- Other AWS principals can create a connection from their VPC to your endpoint service using an interface VPC endpoint or a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint.
	- You are the service provider, and the AWS principals that create connections to your service are service consumers. 

VPC Endpoint Types:
- Interface endpoint: 
	- an elastic network interface.
	- Powered by AWS PrivateLink. 
	- It serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service or a "VPC Endpoint Service" or an AWS Marketplace service.
	- has a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet.
	- Can be associated with multiple subnets in different AZs (1 subnet per AZ).
	- Supports TCP only.
	- you can attach an endpoint policy to it in order to control access to the service to which you are connecting. 
	- Charge per interface.
	- Can be extended to S2S VPN and Direct Connect.
	- Supported within the same Region only.
	- Supports Security Groups.
	- You make requests to the service using the endpoint DNS name.
	- Private DNS option: if enabled (default), associates a private hosted zone with your VPC, allowing you to use the normal AWS service DNS name instead of the endpoint-specific DNS name.


- Gateway endpoint:
	- Introduced by AWS before the PrivateLink technology.
	- Only two supported AWS services: Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
	- Route tables control the routing of traffic between your VPC and the target service. 
	- You specify a gateway endpoint in your route table as a target for traffic destined to the service: Destination=pl-xxxxx and Target=vpce-xxxxxx.
	- Each subnet that's associated with one of these route tables has access to the endpoint, and traffic from instances in these subnets to the target service is then routed through the endpoint. 
	- You can create multiple endpoints in a single VPC, for example, to multiple services. 
	- You can create multiple endpoints for a single service, and use different route tables to enforce different access policies from different subnets to the same service. 
	- Cannot be extended out of a VPC: resources on the other side of a VPN connection, VPC peering connection, transit gateway or AWS Direct Connect connection.
	- Supported within the same Region only.

- Gateway Load Balancer endpoint:
	- This type of endpoint serves as an entry point to intercept traffic and route it to a service that you've configured using Gateway Load Balancers, for example, for security inspection.
	- Gateway Load Balancers enable you to deploy, scale, and manage virtual appliances, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and deep packet inspection systems.
	- has a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet.
	- Powered by AWS PrivateLink. 
	- tied to one subnet.
	- only one can be created in an AZ for any given service.
	- Supports up to 40 Gbps,
	- Does not support security groups nor endpoint policies.
	- Supported within the same Region only.

VPC Gateway Endpoint Policies:
- A sort of resource policy on the endpoint itself.
- Does not provide permissions on the target resources, but rather limits the use of the endpoint itself.
- For S3:
	- You still need to provide IAM permissions on the target S3 buckets.
	- You can optionally restrict access to the target buckets only via a specified VPC endpoint using the condition key: "aws:sourceVpce" (stringEquals or stringNotEquals) in the bucket policy.
	- You cannot refer to the source IP addresses in the S3 bucket policy.

============================

VPC Peering:
- Enables direct VPC to VPC communications without going out to Internet.
- Not transitive.
- Same or different AWS accounts. Same or different Regions.
- Inter-Region VPC Peering is encrypted.
- Supports IPv4 & IPv6.
- No IP overlapping supported.
- Max active VPC peerings per VPC: Default=50, By request=125.
- DNS name resolution is supported: after enabling this option, if instances on either side of the VPC peering connection address each other using a public DNS hostname, the hostname resolves to the private IP address of the instance. 
- You need to Use route tables to configure routing.
- You need to Update inbound & outbound rules for your security groups.
- You cannot use remote gateways (gateways in a peered VPC) through a VPC peering: IGW, VGW, DCX, VPCE.
- Process to create a Peering:
	- you create a VPC peering connection on VPC1,
	- then you go to VPC2 and you find the connection request that you need to accept.
	- you go the route tables of VPC1 and VPC2, you create a route with next-hop is the peering connection ID (starts with pcx-….)

============================

VPC Access options:
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN: connects to a hardware-based VPN. 
- Software Site-to-Site VPN: you use your own VPN software on AWS EC2 (e.g. Cisco, Fortinet, …).
- Client VPN: connects your users to AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.
- Direct Connect: private connection from your premises to AWS.


AWS Site-to-Site VPN:
- The AWS side of a VPN connection can be either a Virtual Private Gateway (only one VPC) or a Transit Gateway.

============================

Virtual Private Gateway (VGW):
- A virtual private gateway is one of the VPN concentrator types on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection. 
- You create a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection. 
- You can have only one VGW per VPC.
- Can be associated to any VPC in the same account and same region.
- Customer Gateway: representation of your on-prem VPN hardware gateway.
- The VGW is redundant by default: has two virtual router nodes using two AZs and two ISPs.
- Tunnel Redundancy:
	- Each Site-to-Site VPN connection has two tunnels, with each tunnel using a unique virtual private gateway public IP address. 
	- Each tunnel uses a different virtual router inside the Virtual Private Gateway service. 
	- Automatic failover.
- Customer Gateway Redundancy:
	- You can set up a second Site-to-Site VPN connection to your VPC and same virtual private gateway by using a second customer gateway device. 
	- In this case, the VGW has 4 tunnels: 2 to each customer gateway device.
	- Use BGP for failover.
- Performance:
	- Each of the two tunnels supports a maximum throughput of up to 1.25 Gbps.
	- In case of a Virtual Private Gateway with multiple VPN connections, the throughput is bound by an aggregate throughput limit from AWS to on-premises of up to 1.25 Gbps.
	- For higher throughput, use transit gateways.
- Accelerated Site-to-Site VPN:
	- You can optionally enable acceleration for your Site-to-Site VPN connection. 
	- Uses AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic from your on-premises network to an AWS edge location that is closest to your customer gateway device.
	- Optimizes the network path, using the congestion-free AWS global network to route traffic to the endpoint that provides the best application performance
	- When you create an accelerated VPN connection, AWS creates and manages two accelerators on your behalf, one for each VPN tunnel. Cannot be viewed.
- The tunnel endpoint and Customer Gateway IP addresses are IPv4 only. However, the transported traffic can be either IPv4 to IPv6.
- Supports static and BGP routing.
- Limitations:
	- One VGW per VPC.
	- No scaling options.
- Autonomous System Number (ASN):
	- When you create a virtual private gateway, you can specify the private ASN for the Amazon side of the gateway.
	- If you don't specify an ASN, the virtual private gateway is created with the default ASN (64512). Cannot be modified.
- VPN CloudHub:
	- A feature of VGW.
	- Used to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between your remote offices. 
	- Operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.
	- Uses an Amazon VPC virtual private gateway with multiple customer gateways, each using unique BGP autonomous system numbers (ASNs).

============================

Transit Gateway (TGW):
- Acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic flowing between your VPCs and on-premises networks. 
- Scales elastically based on the volume of network traffic.
- Transit gateways are highly available by design. You do not need additional transit gateways for high availability.
- Routing through a transit gateway operates at layer 3. 
- Supports Site-to-Site VPN connections (AWS VPN).
- Supports multicast.
- Supported "attachments":
	- One or more VPCs,
	- Direct Connect Gateway
	- Peering connection with another transit gateway (must be in another region),
	- A VPN Connection
	- "Connect" SD-WAN or third party network appliance.
- To use a Transit gateway in a VPC: 
	- You need to attach it to a subnet.
	- The transit gateway places a network interface in that subnet using one IP address from the subnet. 
	- Once attached to a subnet (max 1 subnet per AZ), traffic can be routed to all subnets in that Availability Zone, not just the specified subnet. This is called « Enabling the AZ ».
	- To be able to use the transit gateway in all the subnets of a VPC, you need to attach the transit gateway to one subnet in each Availability Zone.
	- Resources that reside in Availability Zones where there is no transit gateway attachment will not be able to reach the transit gateway. 
- Route table:
	- A transit gateway has a default route table and can optionally have additional route tables. 
	- The target of the routes could be any transit gateway attachment. 
	- By default, transit gateway attachments are associated with the default transit gateway route table. 
	- Each attachment is associated with exactly one route table. 
- Number of transit gateways per Region per account: 5.
- Maximum bandwidth:
	- Burst per VPC, Direct Connect gateway, or peered transit gateway connection: 50 Gbps
	- Per VPN tunnel: 1.25 Gbps. You can use ECMP to get higher VPN bandwidth by aggregating multiple VPN tunnels.


============================

Direct Connect (DX):
- links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable.
- One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. 
- Physical Connection Options:
	- Circuit between the customer premises and the DX location.
	- Circuit between the customer premises and an SP offering DX. Particularly useful for MPLS.
	- Customer router in the same location as the DX router.
- Direct Connect is not redundant by default (one circuit by default).
- Predictable bandwidth and Performance,
- Supports VLAN trunking (802.1Q)
- Connection types: dedicated or hosted.
- Dedicated connection:
	- For a single customer.
	- Single or multiple 1G, 10G or 100G ports.
	- Supports port aggregation with LAG (LACP) for up to 4 x 1/10G ports or 2 x 100G ports.
- Hosted connection:
	- Managed by an AWS partner. 
	- The partner can share a 10G link between several customers.
	- Starts at 50 Mbps.
- A connection of 1 Gbps or more can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces (VIFs).
- A connection of less than 1 Gbps supports only one virtual interface.
- You must create one of the following virtual interfaces to begin using your AWS Direct Connect connection:
	- Public VIF: allows connectivity to public IP addresses in AWS over the DX instead of traversing internet: connectivity to an AWS Service, to your public AWS network or those of other AWS customers.
	- Private VIF: access a VPC using private IP addresses.
	- Transit VIF: access one or more Amazon VPC Transit Gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. You can use transit virtual interfaces with 1/2/5/10/100 Gbps AWS Direct Connect connections. 
	- Hosted VIF: To use your AWS Direct Connect connection with another AWS account, you can create a hosted virtual interface for that account. 

Direct Connect Gateway (DCG): 
- Use AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your Direct Connect to your VPCs.
- A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. 
- You can create the Direct Connect gateway in any Region and access it from all other Regions.
- A DCG can be attached either to a VGW or a Transit Gateway (when you have multiple VPCs in the same region).
- Uses a private virtual interface for the connection to the AWS Direct Connect location.


To connect your AWS Direct Connect connection to your VPCs in the same or different Regions, you need to:
1. Create a private virtual interface for the Direct Connect connection,
2. Create a Direct Connect gateway (DCG), attach the private VIF to this DCG
3. Then, you can either:
	- Create a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) in the VPC, and associate this VGW to the DCG. VPCs connected in this way to the same DCG will not be able to connect to each other through these associations.
	- Create a single Transit Gateway that is attached to the VPC(s). Associate this Transit Gateway to the DCG. In this case VPCs that are attached to the same Transit Gateway can connect to each other through the Transit Gateway. The private VIF in this case is called a Transit Virtual Interface.

Not Supported:
- Associate a virtual private gateway with more than one Direct Connect gateway.
- Direct communication between the VPCs that are associated with a single Direct Connect gateway.
- Direct communication between the virtual interfaces that are attached to a single Direct Connect gateway.

AWS Direct Connect + VPN:
- you can combine AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the AWS Site-to-Site VPN.
- Uses Public VIF only.
- An IPSec tunnel is established between your AWS gateway (VGW or TGW) and the on-prem router/firewall.

============================

Software Site-to-Site VPN:
- offers you the flexibility to fully manage both sides of your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your remote network and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. 
- This option is recommended if you must manage both ends of the VPN connection, either for compliance purposes or for leveraging gateway devices that are not currently supported by Amazon VPC’s VPN solution.

============================

VPC Flow Logs:
- A feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3.
- Flow log data is collected outside of the path of your network traffic, and therefore does not affect network throughput or latency.
- You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface. 
- You can create flow logs for network interfaces that are created by other AWS services, such as: ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, NAT Gateway, Transit Gateway.
- You can specify the type of traffic to capture (accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic).
- You can optionally specify a custom format for the flow log record.
- Default aggregation interval: 10mn.
- A Flow log cannot be modified.
- Some traffic like DHCP is not logged.
- If your network interface has multiple IPv4 addresses and traffic is sent to a secondary private IPv4 address, the flow log displays the primary private IPv4 address in the dstaddr field. To capture the original destination IP address, create a flow log with the pkt-dstaddr field.
- Example of use case: Flow Logs sends logs to CloudWatch Logs which generates metrics that trigger CloudWatch alarms which call actions (SNS, Lambda, …).


Traffic Mirroring:
- A VPC feature that you can use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon EC2 instances.
- You can then send the traffic to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances
- You can filter the traffic to be mirrored.
- Any traffic that matches the filter rules is encapsulated in a VXLAN header. It is then sent to the target on UDP port 4789.
- The target can be in another AWS account.
- The target can be either a Network interface or a Network Load Balancer.
