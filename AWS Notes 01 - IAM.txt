===============================================


AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
- IAM is a free service.
- Supports MFA
- Can also provide access to AWS resources for applications running on EC2.
- Supports federation with external identity providers.
- PCI DSS compliant.
- IAM Resources (objects): user, group, role, policy, identity provider.
- IAM identity: user, group or role.
- IAM Principal: a person or application that is authenticated using an IAM identity in order to make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource.

Root User:
- When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.
- This identity is called the AWS account root user. 
- Only one root user per account.
- The root user is identified by an email address.
- Logs in to the AWS management console from a global generic portal.
- The root user can create users and groups in IAM.

IAM Users:
- A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.
- A user logs in the AWS Management Console from an account-specific portal.
- A user that represents an application is called a Service Account.

IAM Credentials:
- Console password: for AWS Management Console.
- Access Keys: 
	- A combination of an access key ID and a secret access key. 
	- You can assign two to a user at a time.
	- Can be used in API calls, CLI and PowerShell.
	- Enabling MFA has no effect on Access Keys.
- SSH Keys: for AWS CodeCommit only.
- Server certificates: for some AWS services.

IAM Groups:
- You can add a user to a maximum of 10 groups.
- Groups cannot be nested.
- A group cannot be identified as a Principal in a resource-based policy. 

IAM Roles:
- An IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. 
- Has some similarities to an IAM user. Roles and users are both AWS identities with permissions policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. 
- However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
- When you assume a role, the AWS Security Token Service (STS) provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session. 
- Assuming a role = getting temporary keys to perform the actions allowed for that role.
- While a user is assuming a role, he looses access to his original user permissions.

AWS Service Roles:
- A service role: A role that a service assumes to perform actions in your account on your behalf. 

AWS Service-Linked Role:
- A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an AWS service (linked service). 
- Service-linked roles are predefined by the linked service and include all the permissions that the linked service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
- Can be created in 3 ways:
	- An AWS service automatically creates the role (e.g. Auto Scaling: used to manage EC2 instances).
	- You create the role as part of a wizard or process in the AWS service.
	- The service might require that you use IAM to create or delete the role. 
- The user who creates the linked service needs to have the permission to create Service-linked roles.
- The permissions granted by a service-linked role are indirectly transferable to other users: after the service-linked role is created, all users that have access to the linked AWS service will get indirect access to the services referred in the role permissions.
- Cannot be deleted until all resources created by that role have been deleted.

EC2 Instance Profile:
- An IAM role that you can attach to an EC2 instance.
- The AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, and Tools for Windows PowerShell automatically get the temporary credentials from the EC2 instance metadata service and use them. 
- Applications running on that instance can retrieve temporary security credentials from STS (AssumeRole call) and perform actions that the role allows.
- An instance can assume only one IAM role at a time.
- Replacing the role of an instance has immediate effect.

IAM Permissions:
- let you specify access to AWS resources.
- are the building blocs of policies.
- To grant permissions to IAM entities (users and roles) you put the permissions in a policy and then attach the policy to the entity.
- Permissions decision tree:
	- Firsty looks for explicit denies,
	- Secondly looks for explicit allows,
	- Lastly denies any action that is not explicitly allowed.

Policy Statement elements:
- Sid (statement ID) is an optional identifier that you provide for the policy statement. 
- Effect:
	- Allow or Deny.
	- If a policy contains both an Allow effect and a Deny effect on the same action, the Deny effect takes precedence.
- Principal: 
	- needed for resource-based policies to indicate the account, user, role, or federated user to which you would like to allow or deny access.
	- Can be a user. Syntax: "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:user/user-name" }
	- Can be a whole account. Syntax: "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root" } or "Principal": { "AWS": "123456789012" }.
	- Federated Web identiy user: "Principal": { "Federated": "graph.facebook.com" }.
	- Federated SAML users: "Principal": { "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:saml-provider/provider-name" }.
- NotPrincipal: specify the IAM user, federated user, IAM role, AWS account, AWS service, or other principal that is not allowed or not denied access to a resource. 
- Action: list of actions that the policy allows or denies. 
- NotAction:
	- explicitly matches everything except the specified list of actions. 
	- use the NotAction element in a statement with "Effect": "Allow" to provide access to all of the actions in an AWS service, except for the actions specified in NotAction. 
	- use the NotAction element in a statement with "Effect": "Deny" to deny access to all of the listed resources except for the actions specified in the NotAction element. 
	- The NotAction/Deny combination does not allow the listed items, but instead explicitly denies the actions not listed. You must still allow actions that you want to allow. 
- Resource: list of resources to which the actions apply. 
- NotResource: matches every resource except those specified. 
- Condition: the circumstances under which the policy applies. 


IAM Policies:
- AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies. 
- Identity-based policies:
	- permissions policies that you attach to an IAM identity, such as an IAM user, group, or role. 
	- control what actions the identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.
	- Two types of identity based policies: inline and managed.
- Resource-based policies:
	- permissions policies that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an IAM role trust policy. 
	- control what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions.
	- Can be used to grant cross-account access to your resources. Refer to the "Cross-Account Access" section below. 
- The IAM service itself (for IAM objects) supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role and defines which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role.
- Because an IAM role is both an identity and a resource, you must attach both a trust policy (who can assume the role) and an identity-based policy (what the role can do) to an IAM role. 

Inline Policies:
- An inline policy is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role). Can be created/modified at any time.
- An IAM identity can have multiple inline policies.
- Main use case for inline polices: you want to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently assigned to an identity other than the one they're intended for.

Managed Policies:
- Customer Managed Policies:
	- You can create standalone policies that you administer in your own AWS account, which we refer to as customer managed policies. 
	- Have automatic versioning. IAM stores up to five versions of your customer managed policies. 
- AWS Managed Policies:
	- are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases.
- Job Functions:
	- A particularly useful category of AWS managed policies that are designed for job functions like Systems Administrator or Network Administrator. 
	- Align closely to commonly used job functions in the IT industry. 
	- One key advantage is that they are maintained and updated by AWS as new services and API operations are introduced. 
- The maximum number of managed policies that you can attach to a user or a group is 10. The consolidated maximum is therefore 110 managed policies per user: 10 + 10x10 (10 policies per user + 10 groups per user x 10 policies per group).

Permission Boundaries:
- A permissions boundary is an advanced feature used to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity.
- You can use an AWS managed policy or a customer managed policy to set the boundary for an IAM entity (user or role): this policy will limit the maximum permissions for the user or role. 
- When the permission boundary is attached to a user/role:
	- He cannot change or remove it from himself or from other users.
	- He cannot create IAM principals without this permissions boundary. This prevents privilege escalation.
- The permission boundary does not provide permissions on its own.
- Identity-based policies (inline or managed) grant permission to the entity, and permissions boundaries limit those permissions. The effective permissions are the intersection of both policy types. 
- Resource-based policies are not limited by permission boundaries.

Cross-Account Access:
- Use case: when you want to allow a user in a trusted account to access a resource in a trusting account.
- Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, some AWS services allow you to use a resource-based policy directly on the target resource (instead of using a role as a proxy). 
- To allow a cross-account access, you need to allow this access in the trusting account AND in the trusted account. Details below:
- Using roles for Cross-account access:
	- You need to create a role in the trusting account that has the required permissions on the target resource.
	- In order to allow a user in the trusted account to assume this role in the trusting account:
		- In the trusting account: the trusted user or the whole trusted account is granted the permission to assume this role.
		- In the trusted account: a policy must allow your user to assume that role in the trusting account.
	- You can optionally use an ExternalID string in the trust policy to avoid the confused deputy problem (see below).
- Using Resource-based policies for Cross-account access:
	- Supported only for some AWS services like S3, SNS and SQS.
	- You define a resource-based policy in the target resource in the trusting account: used only to set a maximum limit of the access you grant to the trusted account.
	- You add the permissions also in the trusted account for the user to perform the actions on the target resource.

The Confused Deputy Problem:
- Scenario: 
	- You contracted another account (deputy) to access your account.
	- The deputy is contracted by many other AWS customers.
	- You create a role that can be assumed by the deputy to provide him access to your resources.
	- You provide the role ARN to the deputy so that he can assume it when needed.
- Problem:
	- A 3rd party account contracts your deputy for his services.
	- The 3rd party guesses your role ARN and provides it to the deputy as if it was their role ARN.
	- The 3rd party instructs the deputy to act on their account.
	- Since they have confused the deputy, he will act on your account instead.
- Solution:
	- The deputy generates an ExternalID string that is unique for each one of his customers.
	- The deputy provides you your unique ExternalID.
	- You add a Condition element to the trust policy of your role. The Condition tests on the sts:ExternalID to check if it matches your unique ExternalID provided by the deputy.
	- The deputy needs to provide both your role ARN and your unique ExternalID when assuming your role.

===========================

IAM Identity Federation:
- Federated users are users (or applications) who do not have AWS accounts. 
- With an identity provider (IdP), you can manage your user identities outside of AWS and give these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account.
- To use an IdP, you create an IAM identity provider entity and establish a trust relationship between your AWS account and the IdP.
- IAM supports IdPs that are compatible with OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0.

IAM Identity Federation with OIDC:
- Works only for mobile apps authentication and not for user access to the AWS Management console.
- Users of your app can sign in using any OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP such as Amazon, Facebook or Google.
- The user app can receive an authentication token from the IdP.
- The user app needs then to exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS (STS) that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. 
- If you don't want to write code in your user app that interacts with a web IdP and the STS service, you need to use Cognito identity pools instead of IAM Identity federation.

IAM Identity Federation with SAML:
- Enables federated SSO for access to AWS Management Console or for using the AWS API operations.
- Use case 1 - Federation to call AWS APIs:
	- You use a SAML assertion (as part of the authentication response) that is generated in your organization to get temporary security credentials from AWS STS.
- Use case 2 - Federation to access the AWS Management Console:
	- Users can sign in to a portal in your organization hosted by a SAML 2.0–compatible IdP, select an option to go to AWS, and be redirected to the AWS management console without having to provide additional sign-in information. 
	- If your identity store is not compatible with SAML 2.0, then you can build a custom identity broker application to perform a similar function: the broker application authenticates users, requests temporary credentials for users from AWS, and then provides them to the user to access AWS resources. 
- Supports Attributes-Based Access Control (ABAC):
	- You can pass user attributes, such as cost center, title, or locale, from your IdPs to AWS as part of the SAML assertion. 
	- These attributes get mapped to session tags in AWS and can be used by aws:PrincipalTag condition key in IAM policies.

===========================

AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO):
- A cloud-based single sign-on (SSO) service focused on SSO for employees when accessing AWS services or cloud apps.
- Identity Sources:
	- You can have only ONE identity source per AWS organization. 
	- Supported identity sources:
		- AWS SSO integrated identity store.
		- Active Directory (either AWS Managed Microsoft AD or your self-managed Active Directory).
		- External SAML 2.0 IdP.
	- If your user directory is Active Directory, AWS SSO adds the SAML IdP capability to your AD.
	- Amazon Cognito is not a supported identity source in AWS SSO.
- Supported applications for SSO:
	- AWS Management Console. 
	- AWS SSO-integrated applications such as Amazon SageMaker or AWS IoT SiteWise.
	- Built-in SAML integrations to many popular SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Box, and Office 365.
	- Custom SAML 2.0 applications.
- User Portal:
	- AWS SSO supports users single sign-on to business applications through web browsers only. Not supported for mobile/desktop applications and API calls.
	- AWS SSO includes a user portal where your end-users can find and access all their assigned AWS accounts, cloud applications, and custom applications in one place. 
	- The user portal gives also users the ability to retrieve temporary credentials for the IAM role of a given AWS account so they can use it for short-term access to the AWS CLI. 
- Permission Sets:
	- A collection of policies that determine an SSO user's permissions to access a given AWS account.
	- Permission sets ultimately get created as IAM roles in a given AWS account, with trust policies that allow users to assume the role through AWS SSO. 
	- Can contain either AWS managed policies (job function policies) or custom policies that are stored in AWS SSO.
	- You can set the session duration: max 12 hours. Default 1 hour.
- Users follow a simple sign-in process to use the AWS Management Console:
	- Users use their directory credentials to sign in to the AWS SSO user portal.
	- Users then choose the AWS account name that will give them federated access to the AWS Management Console for that account.
	- Users who are assigned multiple permission sets choose which IAM role to use.
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC):
	- An authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes. 
	- You can use user attributes that come from any AWS SSO identity source to manage access to your AWS resources.
	- In AWS, these attributes are called tags. 
	- You can use access control attributes in your permission sets using the aws:PrincipalTag condition key for creating access control rules. 
- SSO access to Applications:
	- You can enable SSO access to applications using AWS SSO.
	- You create a trusted relationship between AWS SSO and the application's service provider. 
	- After the application has been successfully added to the AWS SSO console, you can manage which users or groups need permissions to the application.
	- Supports the following applications types:
		- AWS SSO-integrated applications (such as Amazon SageMaker or AWS IoT SiteWise).
		- Cloud applications (such as Salesforce, Box, Slack and Office 365).
		- Custom SAML 2.0 applications.
- AWS SSO Integrates deeply with the AWS Organizations service.
- Enabling AWS SSO, including enabling AWS Organizations, has no impact on the users, roles, or policies that you’re already managing in IAM.
- AWS SSO also supports the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard for enabling automatic provisioning of users and groups from Azure AD or Okta Universal Directory to AWS. 

===========================

AWS Directory Service:
- provides multiple ways to use Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services. 
- Four options:
	- AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (Managed AD).
	- AD Connector.
	- Simple AD.
	- Amazon Cognito.

AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory:
- Also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
- Powered by an actual Microsoft Windows Server Active Directory (AD), managed by AWS in the AWS Cloud.
- Supports federation.
- AWS provides monitoring, daily snapshots, and recovery as part of the service.
- Standard Edition: Up to 5,000 employees and 30,000 objects.
- Enterprise Edition: Up to 500,000 objects.

AD Connector:
- A proxy service to establish a trusted relationship between your Active Directory and AWS. 
- AD Connector doesn’t rely on complex directory synchronization technologies or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
- Uses cases:
	- Sign in to AWS applications such as Amazon WorkSpaces, Amazon WorkDocs, and Amazon WorkMail by using your Active Directory credentials.
	- You can also join your EC2 Windows instances to your on-premises Active Directory domain through AD Connector using seamless domain join. 
	- Provide federated sign-in to the AWS Management Console: authorized Active Directory identities assume AWS IAM roles and get temporary (1hr) AWS credentials from STS.
- An IAM role can be mapped either to an AD User or to an AD Group.
- When an AD User is mapped to multiple IAM roles, he gets a selection page when signing-in on the AWS Management Console to choose the role he wants to use.
- AD Connector is not compatible with RDS SQL Server. 
- A dual Availability Zone proxy service.
- Comes in two sizes, small and large.
- Can add MFA.

Simple AD:
- A Microsoft Active Directory–compatible directory from AWS Directory Service that is powered by Samba 4.
- Supports basic Active Directory features such as user accounts, group memberships, joining a Linux domain or Windows based EC2 instances, Kerberos-based SSO, and group policies.


===========================

Amazon Cognito:
- Identity management solution for B2C or B2B apps for their customers—so a customer-targeted IAM and user directory solution. 
- This fully managed service scales to support hundreds of millions of users. 


Cognito User Pools:
- With Cognito user pool, your users can sign up and sign in to your web or mobile app.
- Your app users can sign in:
	- Either directly through a user pool,
	- or Federate through a third-party identity provider (IdP).
- User Pool:
	- A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito User Pools. 
	- provides User directory management and user profiles.
- Supported federated Identity Providers (IdPs):
	- Social IdPs: Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.
	- OIDC IdPs.
	- SAML IdPs.
- Includes a built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.
- Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.
- After successfully authenticating a user, Amazon Cognito User Pools issues JSON web tokens (JWT).
- Cognito User Pools tokens can be used to:
	- Secure and authorize access to your own APIs,
	- Exchange for AWS credentials. 
	- Directly in API calls to AWS API Gateway.
	- Directly in requests sent to AWS AppSync.
- Cognito User pools use cases:
	- Design sign-up and sign-in webpages for your app.
	- Access and manage user data.
	- Track user device, location, and IP address, and adapt to sign-in requests of different risk levels.
	- Use a custom authentication flow for your app.


Amazon Cognito identity pools (federated identities):
- Enables identity federation to allow access to AWS services (authorization) for federated users.
- This is a more evolved service than the IAM identity federation as Cognito can interact with AWS STS and provide directly the AWS access token to the user app. 
- Supported IdPs:
	- Public providers: Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple.
	- Amazon Cognito User Pools.
	- OIDC IdPs
	- SAML IdPs
- Auth Flow:
	- Your app authenticates to the IdP and gets a token from this IdP.
	- Your app calls GetId to Cognito Identity Pools which returns an identity.
	- Your app calls GetCredentialsForIdentity to Cognito Identity Pools which calls AWS STS on behalf of the user and returns the STS token to your app.
- You can use IAM policies to control access to AWS resources through Amazon Cognito identity pools based on user attributes (ABAC). 
- You can map attributes, within providers’ access and ID tokens or SAML assertions, to tags that can be referenced in the IAM permissions policies. 
- Cognito identity pools use cases:
	- Give your users access to AWS resources, such as an S3 bucket or a DynamoDB table.
	- Generate temporary AWS credentials for unauthenticated users.
- You need to configure your SAML identity provider to have Amazon Cognito as a relying party.


===========================

Amazon Cloud Directory:
- A highly available multi-tenant directory-based store in AWS. 
- Can scale automatically to hundreds of millions of objects as needed for applications. 
- You can organize directory objects into multiple hierarchies to support many organizational pivots and relationships across directory information.
- Examples:
	- A directory of users may provide a hierarchical view based on reporting structure, location, and project affiliation. 
	- A directory of devices may have multiple hierarchical views based on its manufacturer, current owner, and physical location.
